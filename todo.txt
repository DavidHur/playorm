add query by row key

tests for extra data so we can read in row AND read in data we don't have schema for as well to tack on to entity

play plugin for NoSql stuff to make that easier

go back and add saving all partition ids so we can query into getting a list of partitions

don't allow someone to create entity and just save as entity could exist.  This causes index corruption too easy and users
are very likely to accidentally do this.

delayed joins not working yet
